# Butterfly--Scratch
its a simple project created for learning purpose and for fun using scratch visual programming

In Scratch, you can create a simple project where a butterfly sprite flies around the stage and says "hello." Here's a step-by-step guide to creating this project:

Open Scratch:

If you don't have Scratch installed, you can use the online version at https://scratch.mit.edu.
Create a New Project:

Click on "Create" to start a new project.
Delete the Cat Sprite (Optional):

By default, Scratch starts with a cat sprite. You can delete it if you'd like. Right-click on the cat sprite's icon in the Sprite Pane and choose "Delete."
Add a Butterfly Sprite:

Click on the "Choose a Sprite from Library" button to add a butterfly sprite to your project.
Choose a Butterfly Costume:

Click on the "Costumes" tab for the butterfly sprite.
Choose or create a costume that represents a butterfly.
Add Code Blocks to the Butterfly Sprite:

Click on the "Events" category in the Code Blocks Palette.

Drag a "when green flag clicked" block to the Scripts Area.

Click on the "Motion" category in the Code Blocks Palette.

Drag a "go to x: [pick a number] y: [pick a number]" block below the "when green flag clicked" block. This will position the butterfly at the start of the project.

Go back to the "Events" category.

Drag a "forever" block below the "go to x: [pick a number] y: [pick a number]" block. This will make the butterfly's actions repeat continuously.

Go to the "Motion" category.

Drag a "glide [pick a number] secs to x: [pick a number] y: [pick a number]" block inside the "forever" block. Adjust the values to make the butterfly fly around the stage. You can use different x and y values to create a flight path.

Go to the "Looks" category.

Drag a "say [hello] for [2] seconds" block below the "glide" block. Customize the message and duration as needed.

Test Your Project:

Click the green flag at the top of the stage to start your project.
